React is a library for building user interface

react runs on the client as a SPA (single page app) , but can be used to build
full stack app by communicating with as server/API (eg. MERN stack)

React is often reffered to as a front end framework because it is capable and
directly comaprable to a framework such as angular or Vue

uses:
1. structure the view layer of your application
2. reusable components with their own state
3. JSX = dynamic markup
3. interactive UIs with virtual DOM
4. performance and testing
5. very popular in the industry


fundamentals:
datatypes , variables , functions , loops , etc 
promises and asynchronous programming
array methods like for each() and map()
Fetch API and making HTTP requests

Working with state
--components can have state which is an object that detemines how a component
renders and behaves

"app" or "global" state refers to state that is available to the entire UI , 
not just a single component

earlier we use class based component to use state , now we use 
functional component with hooks

REACT HOOKS 

React hooks are functions that let us hook into the React state and lifecycle 
features from a function component

* useState   - -returns a stateful value and function to update it
*useEffect -- Perform side effects in function component
* useContext ,useReducer , useRef

we can create our own custom hooks
